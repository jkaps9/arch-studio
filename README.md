## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email` or `Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the contact page map. The addresses we have on the design are fictional, so you'll need to add real addresses for this bonus task.
